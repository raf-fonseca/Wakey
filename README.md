# Wakey: The Alarm That Talks You Awake!

Waking up is toughâ€”especially for heavy sleepers who can't seem to shake off the morning fog! We know how important it is to have a consistent morning routine, but traditional alarms just donâ€™t cut it for many of us. So, we set out to build **Wakey**, an innovative solution to a common problem faced by students and anyone who struggles with waking up. Research shows that engaging in mentally stimulating activities or conversations can *boost* alertnessâ€”this became a core feature of our concept.

## How Wakey Works

The app doesnâ€™t just ring; it makes sure you're truly awake! When setting the alarm, users pick a conversation topic. Once it goes off, they must have a full-on conversation with **Cohere's language model**. The twist? The alarm wonâ€™t stop until the LLM is satisfied that youâ€™re actually awake! ðŸ˜³

But thatâ€™s not allâ€”Wakey takes it further by integrating with your personal calendar. It can answer questions about your upcoming day, giving you personalized reminders while you're still shaking off the sleep. ðŸ“…

## How We Built It

We developed a smooth voice interface using **speech-to-text** to capture user input, which is then sent to Cohereâ€™s LLM. The response is converted back into speech, making the whole interaction feel natural. Thanks to real-time streaming through our backend, we keep everything super fast and responsive. For the calendar feature, we leveraged **Cohereâ€™s RAG functionality**, allowing the LLM to pull relevant schedule information on-demand.

## Challenges We Conquered

One of our biggest hurdles was making all these different systems work together harmoniously. From ensuring reliable **speech-to-text** and **text-to-speech** performance to streaming data in real-time, each element required tight integration. But after lots of debugging and testing, we made it happen! ðŸ’ª

## What We're Proud Of

As a team of beginner developers, reaching the finish line with a functional product was a massive achievement for us. Integrating cutting-edge technologies like LLMs and voice interfaces wasnâ€™t easy, but we learned so much along the way. ðŸš€

## Lessons Learned

- Connecting frontend to backend systems.
- Tackling **mobile development**.
- Mastering **asynchronous functions** and Promises.

## What's Next for Wakey?

Weâ€™re excited to keep improving Wakey by enhancing personalization features, refining wake-up accuracy, and exploring integration with **smart home devices**! The possibilities are endless, and we canâ€™t wait to take Wakey to the next level. ðŸŽ¯
